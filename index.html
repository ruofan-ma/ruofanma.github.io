      <p>I am an Assistant Professor of Political Science at the University of California, Davis. My research lies at
        the
        intersection of Comparative Politics and Political Economy. My work examines how structural economic
        transformations—such as shifting labor markets, the housing crisis, and
        the energy transition—reshape politics in advanced democracies. I study how these changes affect voter
        preferences, the policymaking process, and democratic institutions. My work leverages a range of
        research
        designs and data sources, including natural experiments, large-scale surveys and administrative data.</p>

      <p>Previously, I was a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for the Study of Democratic Politics at <a
          href="https://csdp.princeton.edu/">Princeton University</a>. I graduaded with a PhD from the Department of
        Government at <a href="https://gov.harvard.edu/">Harvard University</a> in
        2022. </p>

      <p> During the summer of 2025, I am a visiting researcher at Humboldt University in Berlin. Please contact me if

            What accounts for differences in electoral success between male and female candidates? We argue that parties
            systematically nominate female candidates to districts where the party is less popular, making it harder for
            women
            to get elected. Our empirical strategy uses the German mixed electoral system to create counterfactual
            gender vote
            gaps. These gaps represent the scenario where male and female candidates are nominated in districts where
            their
            respective parties have equal popularity. Using data on all candidates for the German Bundestag across
            eleven
            elections, we document that female underperformance, and its variation across parties and election years, is
            explained almost entirely by women running in districts where their party is less popular. In contrast, we
            find no
            evidence that voter bias or candidate characteristics play a substantial role. Our argument highlights
            gendered
            party gatekeeping that increases in district strength as an important driver of female underrepresentation.

            A large literature has studied the effects of socialization under authoritarianism on political attitudes.
            In this
            research note, we extend this literature by demonstrating striking gender disparities in the post-transition
            persistence of these effects. We study the case of authoritarian indoctrination in the German Democratic
            Republic
            (GDR) using a regression kink design for causal identification. First, we draw on a unique survey fielded
            right
            before reunification to show that education under authoritarianism substantially reduced support for
            democratic
            capitalism and reunification with the West. In the second step, we triangulate multiple contemporary data
            sources to
            trace the persistence of these effects over time. Three decades after the fall of the GDR, the attitudinal
            effects
            of authoritarian indoctrination persist only among men, but not women. Our results highlight considerable
            heterogeneity in the persistence of authoritarian legacies, raising critical questions about
            post-authoritarian
            "re-socialization" and gendered adaptability.

            Recent experimental studies in the social sciences have demonstrated that perspective-taking conversations
            are effective at reducing prejudicial attitudes and support for discriminatory policies. We ask if such
            interventions can directly affect policy views without changing prejudice. Unfortunately, the identification
            of the controlled direct effect—the natural causal quantity of interest for this question—has required
            strong selection-on-observables assumptions for any mediator. We leverage a recent experimental study with
            multiple survey waves of follow-up to identify and estimate the controlled direct effect using the changes
            in the outcome and mediator over time assuming parallel trends in the potential outcomes. This design allows
            us to weaken the identification assumptions to allow for linear and time-constant unmeasured confounding
            between the mediator and the outcome. We develop a semiparametrically efficient and doubly robust estimator
            for these quantities along with a sensitivity analysis for the key identifying assumption of parallel
            trends. Contrary to what traditional methods find, our approach estimates a controlled direct effect of
            perspective-taking conversations when subjective feelings are neutral but not positive or negative, and this
            result is robust to moderate departures from parallel trends.

            Citizens in authoritarian regimes frequently communicate grievances to the government. While there is some
            evidence that governments respond to such petitions, little is known about the nature of this
            responsiveness: can
            petitions yield tangible improvements to citizens' livelihoods? To answer this question, we assemble a novel
            panel
            of housing-related petitions to the government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and all housing
            constructed
            between 1945-1989. Exploiting the timing of the largest housing program in 1971, we employ a
            difference-in-differences design to show that construction was targeted at regions with higher rates of
            petitioning. We then use a variance decomposition method to benchmark the importance of petitions against
            objective indicators of housing need. Our results suggest that petitions allow citizens to meaningfully
            influence
            the allocation of public resources. The paper contributes to nascent scholarship on responsiveness in
            non-democratic regimes and shows that responsiveness leads to tangible improvements in citizens'
            livelihoods.

            Housing shortages and rising rents have increased demands for affordable housing. In this paper, we examine
            whether
            electoral constraints can undermine local politicians' incentives to build public housing. Empirically, we
            draw on the
            full-count census of all housing built in Germany, data on 19,685 local elections between 1989 and 2011, and
            an original
            survey. Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that incumbents are not rewarded, but
            rather experience
            moderate electoral losses after constructing new public housing. We then show that these losses are not
            primarily driven
            by homeowner opposition or native–foreigner competition. Instead, electoral punishment is largest in
            economically
            disadvantaged municipalities with relatively affordable housing, as voters prioritize spending in other
            local policy
            areas that are crowded out by public housing. Survey evidence demonstrates that electoral constraints emerge
            when
            voters' short-term spending preferences conflict with municipalities' long-term goals to provide affordable
            housing.

          <div id="nimby" style="display:none;"><br>
            Affordable housing is a key challenge of the 21st century. A pivotal driver of growing housing prices is
            residents' opposition to construction, a phenomenon known as NIMBYism ("Not In My Backyard"). To make
            housing more
            affordable, city governments are increasingly implementing rent control policies. Does rent control—by
            making
            tenants more likely to stay in their apartments—spark NIMBYism and thus exacerbate the housing crisis? We
            study
            the case of Berlin, which recently passed a sweeping rent control law. Leveraging two discontinuities in the
            policy, we show that rent control made tenants less NIMBY. Specifically, tenants in rent-controlled
            apartments
            became more likely to approve of local-level construction and immigration, compared to tenants in
            non-rent-controlled apartments. We argue that the decline in NIMBYism is likely due to an economic channel.
            Tenants in urban centers associate construction and immigration with displacement pressures and
            gentrification.
            Rent control alleviates these concerns by providing financial and residential security.

            Elections are the key mechanism through which voters hold elected officials accountable. The partisan
            composition of local, state, and federal governments, in turn, shapes policy choices and public goods
            provision. Yet studying representation, government responsiveness, and partisan politics across multiple
            levels of government—especially at the local level—has been difficult due to inconsistently reported,
            incomplete, or insufficiently harmonized election data at small geographic scales. This paper introduces
            GERDA (https://www.german-elections.com/), a panel dataset of local, state, and federal election results in
            Germany at the municipality level spanning the past three decades. GERDA includes turnout and vote shares
            for all major parties and resolves challenges arising from municipal boundary changes and joint mail-in
            voting districts, yielding a consistent panel of municipalities in their 2021 boundaries. We also provide
            municipal and county boundary shapefiles to facilitate spatial analyses. Our dataset enables new research on
            partisan politics, policy responsiveness, and political representation at fine-grained geographic scales and
            over time.

            How does the decline of local news affect political polarization? We provide novel panel evidence on this
            question
            in a multi-party setting. In particular, we shed light on the link between newspaper exits, media
            consumption, and
            ultimately electoral behavior. To study the aggregate relationship between local news exits and
            polarization, we
            rely on a unique panel of all German local newspapers between 1980 and 2009. In addition, we precisely trace
            individual-level mechanisms by drawing on an annual media consumption survey of more than 670,000
            respondents over
            three decades. Using a difference-in-differences design, we demonstrate that local newspaper exits increase
            electoral polarization, which aligns with evidence from the American context. Going beyond prior work, we
            then
            document that local news exits increase polarization because affected constituents substitute local news
            with
            national tabloid news. Finally, we show that local news exits increase politicization and partisanship at
            the
            individual level.

            Why is support for the radical right higher in some geographic locations than others? This paper argues that

            result
            of something different: communities that were in the historical "periphery" in the center-periphery
            conflicts of
            modern nation-state formation. Inspired by a classic state-building literature that emphasizes the
            prevalence of a
            "wealth of tongues" (Weber 1976)—or nonstandard linguistic dialects in a region—as a definition of the
            periphery,
            we use data from more than 725,000 geo-coded responses in a linguistic survey in Germany to show that voters
            from
            historically peripheral geographic communities are more likely to vote for the radical right today.

            Does the economic integration of refugees affect public attitudes toward migration? We assess this pertinent
            question by examining a policy change in Germany, where the government significantly eased labor market
            access for
            refugees in the majority of the country. Using administrative employment data, we show that the policy led
            to a
            substantial increase in refugee employment, while natives' wages and employment rates remained unaffected.
            The
            policy also had a positive effect on natives' attitudes toward migration. Voters exposed to more refugees in
            the
            labor market were two percentage points more likely to vote for pro-migration parties across both state and
            federal elections. Additional survey analyses suggest that our results are driven by positive native-refugee
            interactions in the workplace.

            A growing literature shows that extreme weather events induce pro-environment attitudes. We examine the
            political
            effects of a severe flood shortly before the 2021 German federal election. Drawing on about 600,000 survey
            responses and electoral data, we assess how flooding affected (i) the perceived salience of climate change,
            (ii)
            self-reported Green Party support, and (iii) Green Party voting in federal elections. We find that even
            severe
            local flooding had little to no effect on these outcomes. Additional evidence supports two mechanisms
            underlying
            this finding: nationwide rather than local effects of severe disasters, and voter demands for disaster
            relief
            rather than climate change prevention. We test the former mechanism using a regression discontinuity design
            and
            find that the flood increased nationwide Green Party support, although this effect persists for only two
            weeks.
            Our results shed new light on the precise duration and geographic scope of the political effects of natural
            disasters.

            Does government spending on public goods affect the vote choice of citizens? On the one hand, voters have
            been
            characterized as "fiscal conservatives" who may turn toward conservative parties when government spending
            goes up.
            On the other hand, increased spending may signal that the economy is doing well, which makes progressive
            parties a
            more viable option. To adjudicate between both hypotheses, this paper draws on a natural experiment, which
            created
            exogenous variation in government spending. A discontinuity in the 2011 German census meant that some
            municipalities saw an unforeseen increase in budgets. Using a regression discontinuity design, we show that
            the
            increase in budgets and subsequent spending on public goods benefited left-leaning parties, but had no
            effect on
            incumbent support. To parse out the causal channel, we rely on panel evidence and demonstrate that treated
            residents viewed their economic situation more favorably, which led them to espouse progressive parties.

            We examine how local news monopolies affect misperceptions about the size of the immigrant population in
            Germany.
            We propose a theoretical framework in which heterogeneous information from different local news outlets
            diffuses
            through social interactions. We posit that indirect exposure to information from multiple sources leads to
            more
            accurate beliefs in competitive markets. To causally identify the effect of local news monopolies on
            misperceptions, we exploit overlapping newspaper coverage areas as a source of exogenous variation in the
            number
            of available outlets. We estimate that local news monopolies increase misperceptions about the size of the
            local
            immigrant population by about four percentage points. We demonstrate that the effect of media monopolies
            hinges on
            social interactions. For individuals with fewer close social contacts, misperceptions remain unaffected by
            local
            news monopolies. Our results suggest that consolidation in the market for news decreases constituents'
            knowledge
            about critical policy issues.

            How do freedom of movement restrictions affect refugee integration? While a growing body of research studies
            the
            initial spatial allocation of refugees, there is little causal evidence on subsequent policies that restrict
            residential mobility. We study a contentious law in Germany, which barred refugees from moving to a location
            different from the one they were randomly assigned to. To identify the causal effect of the movement
            restriction
            on integration, we utilize a sharp date cutoff that governs whether refugees are affected by the policy. We
            demonstrate that restricting freedom of movement had pronounced negative effects on refugees' sense of
            belonging
            in Germany while increasing identification with their home countries. In addition, the policy decreased
            engagement
            in a variety of social activities. Our findings suggest that discriminatory policies send a negative signal
            about
            the inclusiveness of the host society and thereby reduce the psychological integration of refugees.

            How does a criminal record shape interactions with the State and society? We present evidence from a
            nationwide
            field experiment, showing that prospective applicants with criminal records are about five percentage points
            less
            likely to receive information from college admission offices. However, we demonstrate that bias does not
            extend to
            race. There is no difference in response rates to Black and White applicants. We further show that bias is
            all but
            absent in public bureaucracies, as discrimination against formerly incarcerated applicants is driven by
            private
            schools. Examining why bias is stronger for private colleges, we demonstrate that the private-public
            difference
            persists even after accounting for college selectivity, socio-economic composition, and school finances.
            Moving
            beyond the measurement of bias, we evaluate an intervention aimed at reducing discrimination: whether an
            email
            from an advocate mitigates bias associated with a criminal record. However, we find no evidence that
            advocate
            endorsements decrease bureaucratic bias.

            Does public opinion affect political speech? Of particular interest is whether public opinion affects (i)
            what
            topics politicians address and (ii) what positions they endorse. We present evidence from Germany where the
            government was recently forced to declassify its public opinion research, allowing us to link the content of
            the
            research to subsequent speeches. Our causal identification strategy exploits the exogenous timing of the
            research's dissemination to cabinet members within a window of a few days. We find that exposure to public
            opinion
            research leads politicians to markedly change their speech. First, we show that linguistic similarity
            between
            political speech and public opinion research increases significantly after reports are passed on to the
            cabinet,

            Why are some societies more unequal than others? The French revolutionaries believed unequal inheritances
            among
            siblings to be responsible for the strict hierarchies of the ancien regime. To achieve equality, the
            revolutionaries therefore enforced equal inheritance rights. Their goal was to empower women and to
            disenfranchise
            the noble class. But do equal inheritances succeed in leveling the societal playing field? We study
            Germany—a
            country with pronounced local-level variation in inheritance customs—and find that municipalities that
            historically equally apportioned wealth, to this day, elect more women into political councils and have
            fewer
            aristocrats in the social elite. Using historic data, we point to two mechanisms: wealth equality and
            pro-egalitarian preferences. In a final step, we also show that, counterintuitively, equitable inheritance
            customs
            positively predict income inequality. We interpret this finding to mean that equitable inheritances level
            the
            playing field by rewarding talent, not status.

            Green transition policies set long-term targets to reduce carbon emissions and other pollutants, posing a
            threat
            to workers in polluting occupations and communities reliant on these occupations. Can far-right parties
            attract
            voters who anticipate losing from the green transition? We explore this in Germany, which has ambitious
            green
            policies and a large workforce in polluting occupations. The far-right AfD started campaigning as the only
            party
            opposing green transition policies in 2016. Using a difference-in-differences design, we show AfD support
            increased in counties with more polluting jobs after this platform change. A panel survey further
            demonstrates
            that individuals in these occupations also shifted towards the AfD. Probing mechanisms, we find suggestive
            evidence that growing far-right support is due to changing perceptions of social stigma and lower status.
            Our
            results highlight the need for a new research agenda on a backlash against the normative dimension of the
            green
            transition.

            How do street-level bureaucrats respond when courts reshape public policy? The 2023 Supreme Court decision
            striking down affirmative action altered the legal framework around college admissions, prompting
            speculation about its implications for administrative behavior and minority representation on campus. Yet
            existing work offers limited evidence on whether -- and how -- bureaucrats adapt to judicial interventions.
            We investigate whether college admissions officers shift behavior in response to the ruling. We report
            results from two original field experiments with over 3,000 U.S. admissions offices. In Study 1, we
            recontact institutions from a 2018 audit testing responsiveness to Black and White applicants, enabling a
            pre-post comparison. In Study 2, we randomly vary applicant race (Asian, Black, White) and references to the
            Court's decision. Across both studies, we find no evidence of racial bias, even when the ruling is salient.
            Together, these null results suggest limits to the judiciary's influence on bureaucratic behavior.

            Place-based economic policies are increasingly seen as instruments to counter political discontent in
            economically-depressed regions. Do regional investment subsidies affect electoral behavior? We evaluate this
            question in the context of Germany's largest regional investment program. Our identification strategy
            leverages a
            2014 subsidy rate cut for manufacturing firms that—due to EU rules—was exogenous to local economic trends.
            The
            subsidy cut reduced voting for the far-right AfD and increased support for the incumbent Christian
            Democrats. We
            then demonstrate that subsidy cuts trigger two counterreactions: local firms invest more in human capital
            and
            local governments invest more in infrastructure and public goods. We argue that these dynamics signal to
            voters
            that local governments are responsive and care about their constituents, undermining populist appeals. Our
            findings suggest that political consequences of place-based policies—and austerity more broadly—cannot be
            understood without considering counteractions by local firms and governments.

            Do political and social features of states help explain the evolving distribution of reported Covid-19
            deaths? We
            identify national-level political and social characteristics that past research suggests may help explain
            variation in a society's ability to respond to adverse shocks. We highlight four sets of arguments—focusing
            on (1)
            state capacity, (2) political institutions, (3) political priorities, and (4) social structures—and report
            on
            their evolving association with cumulative Covid-19 deaths. After accounting for a simple set of
            Lasso-chosen
            controls, we find that measures of government effectiveness, interpersonal and institutional trust,
            bureaucratic
            corruption, and ethnic fragmentation are currently associated in theory-consistent directions. We do not,
            however,
            find associations between deaths and many other political and social variables that have received attention
            in
            public discussions, such as populist governments or women-led governments. Currently, the results suggest
            that
            state capacity is more important for explaining Covid-19 mortality than government accountability to
            citizens,
            with potential implications for how the disease progresses in high-income versus low-income countries. These
            patterns may change over time with the evolution of the pandemic, however.
